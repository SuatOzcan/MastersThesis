This is my master's thesis. I trained machine learning models for the Starcraft real-time strategy game. The models try to predict which unit to produce, just as the professional players would. I created the dataset from the database created by Ian Watson and Glen Robertson. The dataset consists of 812 Terran-versus-Zerg games played by professional players. I grouped units according to their ranges, so model accuracies increased notably. Models acquire over 90% accuracy and, in a particular range classification, 100% accuracy.
